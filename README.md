Forum App
Real-world examples: Reddit, StackOverflow, freeCodeCamp Forum

A forum application is where we go when we want to get help, and as programmers we visit forums like Reddit and Stack Overflow to get our coding questions answered.

Forums also combine many elements of chat and social media apps through posts, comments, and reactions. A forum is more of a more organized version of a social media app where users can more easily find answers to questions they're looking for.

How to build a forum app:
Build your frontend with create-react-app, and backend using a Node API
Use a database like Postgres or MongoDB, along with an ORM like Prisma (Postgres) or Mongoose (MongoDB)
Use social authentication with Google, Facebook or Twitter, using Passport or a simpler service like Auth0
Deploy the backend to Heroku, frontend to Netlify
